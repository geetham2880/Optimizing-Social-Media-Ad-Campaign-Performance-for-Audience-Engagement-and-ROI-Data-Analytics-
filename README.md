# Optimizing-Social-Media-Ad-Campaign-Performance-for-Audience-Engagement-and-ROI-Data-Analytics-

Business Context
TrendWave has run paid campaigns across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn for three months.
Data includes daily impressions, clicks, conversions, ad spend, and demographic breakdowns.
Despite substantial investment, there is no clarity on which platforms, creatives, and audience segments deliver the best value.
With quarterly targets approaching, the company requires an analytical framework to:
• Allocate ad budgets across platforms for optimal CPA
• Compare performance across audience demographics and segments
• Identify underperforming campaigns for reallocation or optimization
• Detect time-based performance trends and seasonality
• Provide evidence-backed recommendations for the next product launch

Problem Statement
Primary Challenge: Lack of a performance analysis framework to evaluate social media channels, quantify the impact of ad spend on conversions, and optimize targeting strategies.
This results in suboptimal ROI and missed growth opportunities.

Key Questions to Address
Which age and gender groups are responsible for the highest sales and ad spend, and how does their conversion efficiency compare?
How effective is the campaign in converting impressions into clicks and clicks into sales (CTR and Conversion Rate)?
Are there significant differences in CPA and CPM between demographic segments, and what does this imply for budget optimization?

KPIs Generated
• CPM (Cost per Mille): Cost of 1,000 impressions
• CPC (Cost per Click): Cost of each click
• CTR (Click-Through Rate): Percentage of impressions converted into clicks
• CPA (Cost per Acquisition): Cost of acquiring a new customer
